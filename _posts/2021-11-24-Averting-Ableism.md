What can we do to recognize and avert ableism?
 • Believe people when they disclose a disability
 • Similarly, don’t accuse people of ‘faking’ their disability
 • Listen to people when they request an accommodation
 • Don’t assume you know what someone needs
 • Never touch a person with a disability or their mobility equipment without consent
 • Keep invasive questions to yourself
 • Don’t speak on behalf of someone with a disability unless they explicitly ask you to
 • Talk about disability with children and young people
