What can we do to recognize and avert ableism?

 • Believe people when they disclose a disability

 • Similarly, don’t accuse people of ‘faking’ their disability

 • Listen to people when they request an accommodation

 • Don’t assume you know what someone needs

 • Never touch a person with a disability or their mobility equipment without consent

 • Keep invasive questions to yourself

 • Don’t speak on behalf of someone with a disability unless they explicitly ask you to

 • Talk about disability [with children and young people](https://nebula.wsimg.com/07ff3147582a2b7c1dd5404791dc477b?AccessKeyId=9D6F6082FE5EE52C3DC6&disposition=0&alloworigin=1)

## The R-Word
The R-Word is now used as a derogatory term and an insult. The word now is a term that is thrown around causally, but many don’t know the backstory. 

This word was used to describe people who have an intellectual disability, and as the term is being used in a derogatory and hurtful way, it gives the impression that the person using it thinks that people with disabilities are lesser than, therefore it is ableist. 

To simply remove this word from your vocabulary or to use it very carefully can make a difference to growing as a person and improving the social construct of disabled people’s lives.
