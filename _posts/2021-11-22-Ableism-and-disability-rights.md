Ableism is a type of discrimination against disabled people, or in favour of able-bodied people, which can take many forms. While expressed hatred and denial of accessibility are commonly observed discriminatory conduct, ableism includes less-obvious actions as well. Ableism is all around us. 

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 stated to be implemented for empowerment of persons with disabilities (PWD) are respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy including the freedom to make one's own choices, and independence of persons. 

The Act lays stress on non-discrimination, full and effective participation and inclusion in society, respect for difference and acceptance of disabilities as part of human diversity and humanity, equality of opportunity, accessibility, equality between men and women, respect for the evolving capacities of children with disabilities, and respect for the right of children with disabilities to preserve their identities. 

The principle reflects a paradigm shift in thinking about disability from a social welfare concern to a human rights issue. One thing every able-bodied person can do to help combat this form of social discrimination is to educate themselves and others, so the problem becomes more widely understood. Then, it becomes everyoneâ€™s duty to think about the ableist implications their actions might have, especially as it relates to social justice initiatives that might overlook disabled populations.
