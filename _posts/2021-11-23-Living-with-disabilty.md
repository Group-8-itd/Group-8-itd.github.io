The system of ableism is fighting for disabled in this current world. The living reality of ableism is that not every disability is visible. The use of ableist language happens every day. It has become so embedded in our conscience that we hardly even think about it.

“Are you mentally retarted?”, “You couldn’t see it? You must be blind.” “Stop walking like a limp.” “She is a psycho.” “You can’t understand that simple math? Are you dumb?” Using phrases like these imply that a disability makes a person lesser than and that they are inferior.

Language can also be a tool of oppression. As self-ware individuals, we should be careful on not propagating an ableist culture that devalues an individual on any ground. 

The living reality of our society is that it can sometimes be insensitive. It reeks of casual but sure discrimination. Yet unlike other types of discrimination, ableism is so subtle that we see it every day but we do not even know as we have become desensitised to it. Rather, we contribute to it without even realising it.
