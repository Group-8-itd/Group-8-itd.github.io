Being a person with disabilities is not a weakness, but just a small obstacle. Its not something to be ashamed about, but an identity to be embraced. The movie “Sound of Metal” – directed by Darius Marder and storied by Derek Cianfrance, changed our perception and may change yours too.

It beautifully explains the idea when Ruben the protagonist started to loose his hearing – struggled with the societal perception of being a deaf metal music artist. The movie started with the struggle and ended with acceptance.

All the characters and their opinions in the movie were justified in their own rights and the movie did a remarkable job in balancing those ideas, estabilishing the concepts of ableism without any propaganda like ideas. Its this mode of enquiry that Disablity Studies try to estabilish.
