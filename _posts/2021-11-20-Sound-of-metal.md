Being a person with disabilities is not a weakness, but just a small obstacle. Its not something to be ashamed about, but an identity to be embraced. The movie “Sound of Metal” – directed by Darius Marder and storied by Derek Cianfrance, changed our perception and may change yours too.

It beautifully explains the idea when Ruben the protagonist started to loose his hearing – struggled with the societal perception of being a deaf metal music artist. The movie started with the struggle and ended with acceptance.

The movie started with Ruben and Lou, a budding metal duo band on a live concert tour. On the tour Ruben starts to loose his hearing ability. As soon as he realizes that something is going on, he gets an expert opinion, and finds out the the only solution to get back his hearing would be to get surgical implants. It did not take much time for the live in couple to realise that surgery was very expensive. Lou insists Ruben to join a deaf support group and learn the new normal by learning sign language and learn living without hearing.

Ruben subsequently joins the camp, gets well versed with the new normal. However, he still manages to get the surgical implant By selling all of his assets. The movie also shows the disadvantages of getting the implants – that even if the surgery is successful, the hearing still feels unnatural and static like.

It was the end, that justified the whole movie. When Ruben realizes that he needs to embrace the silence, with him removing his implants from the ears. The whole movie portrayed our protagonist fighting with himself to adjust to the societal norms. However, it was end where he accepted himself for what he was, accepting his inner beauty.

All the characters and their opinions in the movie were justified in their own rights and the movie did a remarkable job in balancing those ideas, estabilishing the concepts of ableism without any propaganda like ideas. Its this mode of enquiry that Disablity Studies tries to estabilish
