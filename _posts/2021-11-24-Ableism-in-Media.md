Why is it that actors/actresses have to "act" as a person with a disability on television? Why do televisions shows portray many characters with disabilities as being helpless or unable to act in society like everyone else?

Many televisions shows and movies have characters with disabilities but many of them do not actually have them in real life. Every television show, book, and ever film should be showing real people with disabilities, because they exist and have always existed. 

Who are we to throw the word "retard" around? What makes it right for anyone to be able to look at someone with a disabilities and say they are completely different from everyone else in the world? In regards to the media, this is what I want to change:
