People don't question the beliefs and attitudes that relegate people with disability as lesser and inferior. Ableism is rife in our community, and all too easy to excuse. 

The discrimination is hidden in plain sight. The present fabric of the society is dynamic, infused with all-inclusive youth who do not tolerate any hand-me-down baton of oppression and despotism. And to exclude someone based on something they didn’t choose is blatant discrimination.

People are not defined by a single trait of their physical appearance or by a social construct like gender and yet, people are defined by their disability. A person in wheelchair can do everything an abled person can, can have the same ideas and want fulfilment like everyone else. 

An autistic child deserves the same empathy and love like any other child. However, their stories are so underrepresented, their voices are suppressed by unwanted pity party, that the only time they are shown in positive light is when they become ‘inspiring stories’ after fighting against a system that is designed for their exclusion.
