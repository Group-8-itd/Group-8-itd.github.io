You have probably seen posts with a picture of a disabled athlete with the caption “What’s your excuse?”. This is an example of ableism in the formal systems.

This way of using people with disabilities as objects of inspiration is not just for athletes but also for people with disabilities who are just living their day-to-day lives, not doing anything extraordinary. Yet, they are called “brave” or “inspirational,” which wouldn’t be the case if they were not disabled. 

Stella Young, in her TED talk, speaks about how disabled people are objectified for the benefit of non-disabled people and that living with a disability is considered to be extraordinary. 

A few other examples of ableism in the formal systems include discriminating against people with disabilities when hiring, choosing an inaccessible venue for a meeting or an event, asking invasive questions about a person’s medical history, using ableist language. You should be inclusive of disabled people by avoiding such ableist acts.
