This website is created as a part of undegraduate course on Introduction to Disability Studies taken by Prof. Shilpaa Anand.
We the students of Group 8 had to evolve a social media campaign in order to spread awareness about Ableism and how it affects
lives of people with disability. 

We decided to create a blog where we would completely focus on our topic and create posts without any restrictions. 
In order to make the site more accessible for all we decided to include sound tracks for the articles published and created
a poster page where we would post images. 

Hopefully through our series of articles and posters we have made the readers aware about what difficulty disabled people face owing to ableism! 
This would in turn be a place to make people think about a truly equal society for all.
